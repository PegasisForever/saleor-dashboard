## Summary

Resumed monitoring PR #2 on invocation 27 after twenty-sixth raise-cap escalation. Re-ran artifact cleanup, re-added `github` remote, pushed current HEAD to PR head branch, and polled ~90s with no reviews, comments, or CI events. Returning `BLOCKED: other` — PR open awaiting human merge; same schema gap as invocations 1–26.

## Decisions made independently

- **Skip re-opening PR**: PR #2 already exists at https://github.com/PegasisForever/saleor-dashboard/pull/2; pushed to existing head branch per invocation 2–26 precedent.
- **Re-run artifact cleanup**: Deleted invocation 26 logs, findings, and escalation docs; kept consolidated `prd.md` + `summary.md` unchanged.
- **Skip Linear ticket filing**: DEV-69/DEV-70 already filed in invocation 1; no new out-of-scope findings in remaining artifacts.
- **Return BLOCKED not loop-back**: No feedback, CI failure, or review event to classify.

## Files / sections inspected

- `docs/DEV-68/prd.md`: acceptance criteria unchanged
- `docs/DEV-68/summary.md`: implementation complete, 0 BLOCKERs, DEV-69/DEV-70 follow-ups
- `docs/DEV-68/logs/075-step-9-pr-invocation-26.md`: prior BLOCKED rationale (read before deletion)
- `docs/DEV-68/logs/076-router-mode-b-escalation.md`: twenty-sixth raise-cap +30 resolution (read before deletion)
- `docs/DEV-68/findings/pr/wrun_01KSHRMWGJP4EKKJSB2BPNV8GJ-pr-26.md`: prior monitoring event (read before deletion)
- `docs/DEV-68/findings/escalations/wrun_01KSHRMWGJP4EKKJSB2BPNV8GJ-pr-blocked-26.md`: Mode B escalation #26 findings (read before deletion)
- `git diff 45b5cef8f..HEAD -- 'src/**'`: confirmed copy-link feature diff unchanged from prior invocations
- `gh pr view 2 --repo PegasisForever/saleor-dashboard --json …`: OPEN, MERGEABLE, empty checks/reviews (3 polls)
- `gh pr checks 2 --repo PegasisForever/saleor-dashboard`: no checks reported

## Considered then dropped

- **Opening new PR**: Would duplicate PR #2; current branch pushes to PR head branch `4338218e-…` per established pattern.
- **Returning loop-back for missing CI**: No CI configured on repo — not actionable feedback.
- **Returning merged without human action**: PR still OPEN after polling; schema requires explicit merge event.
- **Rewriting summary.md**: Existing summary from invocation 1 cleanup still accurate; no new findings artifacts to consolidate.

## Dead ends and retries

- None this run — `github` remote add, push, and polling succeeded on first attempt.

## Ambiguities encountered

- **Schema has no passive-monitoring exit**: Only `merged`, `loop-back`, or `blocked` — PR still OPEN after ~90s polling requires `blocked` return per invocations 1–26 precedent.

## Concerns / warnings

- Twenty-seventh consecutive monitoring cycle on merge-ready PR with zero CI/review automation — iteration budget drain without code changes.
- Repo has no branch protection checks; PR agent will keep hitting BLOCKED until human merges PR #2.

## Did not do (out of scope or deferred)

- **Merge PR manually**: Awaits human approver per pipeline design.
- **Post Linear question**: No classification ambiguity requiring human input.
